# The Agile Quality Manifesto
We believe that the adoption of new ways of working and emerging technologies will create a brighter future for patients, increase compliance and safety, and drive the healthcare industry forward.

We value
**Integrated compliance processes over Documentation**
**Compliance Data over Paper**
**Continuous agile change over change review boards**

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
